            <p id="about_us_text" class="light_blue">My name is Naomi Galil, and I am the editor of The Franklin Phoenix. 
                <br> I first had the idea in 2023, and since then, I have worked as hard as I could to fulfill my dream. <br>
                I envisioned a literary magazine with original stories, poems, book reviews, drawings, and advertisements by a wide range of people.<br>
                The idea then grew to include the website, a place where people all over the world could read the magazine's issues and submit content.<br>
                 The magazine has grown a lot, too, in quality and size, because of a large team of helpers, and it is continuing to grow.<br>
                  I am so proud of how far it has come, and excited at how much further it might go. </p>
